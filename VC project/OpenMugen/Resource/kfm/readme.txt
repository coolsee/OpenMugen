      line to the [Characters] group:

      kfm

      It's that easy to get started!

  Controls
  --------

    Basic Controls
    --------------
      Kung Fu Man is a 4-button character. Button X is his weak
      punch, button Y his strong punch, A for weak kick, and
      B for his strong kick. We will use W. to mean weak, and S.
      for strong.

      We will use the notation:
      D - down
      F - forward
      U - up
      B - back
      x - button X (weak punch)
      y - button Y (strong punch)
      a - button A (weak kick)
      b - button B (strong kick)

      DF means diagonally down-forwards, UB diagonally up-back,
      etc. If you see ab it means press button A and button B
      simultaneously. x/y means hit either x or y, and so on.

      Use the direction keys to move KFM. Press down to crouch,
      and up to jump. While in the air, you can press up again to
      air-jump. Hold the direction facing away from the opponent
      to guard. KFM can guard attacks while jumping.

      When falling in the air, hit buttons X and Y at the same
      time to recover. Hold a directional key when recovering to
      move a little bit in that direction. If you are near the
      ground when you hit xy, you will do a ground-based recovery
      instead.

      KFM has a taunt. To do it, press the start button.

  Combo notes
  -----------

    KFM's strengths lie in his ability to chain moves into each
    other. Here are his basic combo rules:

      1.  You can combo from weaker basic attacks into stronger ones
          eg. light kick -> strong kick

      2.  You can combo into special attacks from most basic attacks
          eg. stand strong punch -> Kung Fu Palm

      3.  You can combo into hyper attacks from all basic and special
          attacks
          eg. Kung Fu Palm -> Triple Kung Fu Palm

      4.  You can combo from hyper attacks into other hyper attacks,
          as long as you do not do the same hyper twice in a row
          eg. Triple Kung Fu Palm -> Smash Kung Fu Upper

    These rules make it possible for you to do some damaging combos.
